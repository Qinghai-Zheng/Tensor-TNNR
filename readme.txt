Nuclear Norm Regularization. 24th International Conference on Pattern 
Recognition, Beijing, 2018, p.2600-2605. DOI 10.1109/ICPR.2018.8546008

The code contains:
|--------------
|-- tensor_TNNR_image.m       entrance to start the image experiment
|-- tensor_TNNR_video.m       entrance to start the video experiment
|-- algorithms/               some advanced algorithms
|-- function/                 some basic tensor operators
|-- image/                    directory for original images
|-- mask/                     directory for various mask types, 300x300
|-- result/                   directory for saving experimental results
|-------------

For the algorithm interpretation, please read our Xue et al. (2018) paper
in 24th ICPR and arXiv preprint, in which more details are demonstrated.
